I'm guilty of experiencing this frustration firsthand. Just last week, I was working on a critical project and my laptop suddenly lost connection to the office Wi-Fi. I tried restarting my laptop, checking the Wi-Fi settings, and even asking my IT department for help, but nothing seemed to work. It was like the Wi-Fi was playing a cruel joke on me.

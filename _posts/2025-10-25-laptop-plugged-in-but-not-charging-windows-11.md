**Laptop Plugged In, But Not Charging? Don't Panic!**

I still remember the frustration I felt when my laptop wouldn't charge, even though it was plugged into the wall. I was in the middle of a critical project, and my battery was running on fumes. I tried everything I could think of – checking the cord, the outlet, and even the charging port – but nothing seemed to work. It was like my laptop was playing a cruel joke on me.

If you're experiencing a similar issue with your Windows 11 laptop, don't worry, you're not alone. I'm here to help you troubleshoot and resolve the problem. In this post, I'll walk you through some practical tips and tricks to get your laptop charging again.

**Tip 1: Check the Obvious**

Before we dive into more complex solutions, let's start with the basics. Make sure your laptop is properly plugged into a working outlet. It sounds silly, but it's easy to overlook. Also, check that the charging cable is securely connected to both the laptop and the wall. A loose connection can prevent your laptop from charging.

I recall a time when I was working from a coffee shop and my laptop wouldn't charge. I was about to give up when I realized I had accidentally plugged the charging cable into a USB port instead of the dedicated charging port. Duh! It's amazing how often we overlook the simplest solutions.

**Tip 2: Update Your Power Management Settings**

Windows 11 has a built-in power management system that can sometimes interfere with charging. To check if this is the issue, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings > System > Power & battery.
2. Click on "Additional power settings" on the right side of the screen.
3. Click on "Change plan settings" next to your current power plan.
4. Click on "Change advanced power settings."
5. Scroll down to "Power buttons and lid" and click on "Power button action."
6. Make sure that "Do nothing" is selected for "On battery" and "Plugged in."

By default, Windows 11 is set to turn off the charging port when the laptop is turned off or in sleep mode. This can prevent your laptop from charging when it's plugged in. By changing these settings, you can ensure that your laptop charges even when it's turned off or in sleep mode.

**Tip 3: Disable Fast Startup**

Fast Startup is a feature in Windows 11 that can sometimes prevent your laptop from charging. To disable it, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings > System > Power & battery.
2. Click on "Additional power settings" on the right side of the screen.
3. Click on "Change plan settings" next to your current power plan.
4. Click on "Change advanced power settings."
5. Scroll down to "Power buttons and lid" and click on "Turn on fast startup (recommended)."
6. Uncheck the box next to "Turn on fast startup (recommended)."

By disabling Fast Startup, you can ensure that your laptop charges properly even when it's turned off or in sleep mode.

**Tip 4: Check for Driver Updates**

Outdated drivers can sometimes cause issues with charging. To check for driver updates, follow these steps:

1. Go to Device Manager (Press the Windows key + X and select Device Manager).
2. Expand the "Battery" section.
3. Right-click on the battery driver and select "Update driver."
4. Follow the prompts to search for and install any available updates.

By keeping your drivers up to date, you can ensure that your laptop charges properly and efficiently.

**Tip 5: Run a System File Checker**

System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool in Windows 11 that can help identify and fix corrupted system files. Corrupted system files can sometimes cause issues with charging. To run SFC, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator (Press the Windows key + X and select Command Prompt (Admin)).
2. Type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter.
3. Follow the prompts to complete the scan.

By running SFC, you can identify and fix any corrupted system files that may be causing issues with charging.

**Conclusion**

Laptop plugged in, but not charging? Don't panic! By following these practical tips and tricks, you can troubleshoot and resolve the problem. Remember to check the obvious, update your power management settings, disable Fast Startup, check for driver updates, and run a System File Checker. With a little patience and persistence, you'll have your laptop charging again in no time.

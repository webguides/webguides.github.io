I still remember the day my laptop touchpad right click stopped working. I was in the middle of a project, and I desperately needed to right click to access some important options. But every time I tried to click, nothing happened. It was like my touchpad had developed a mind of its own, refusing to cooperate with me.

I'm not alone in this struggle, of course. Many of us have experienced the frustration of a non-functional laptop touchpad right click. But don't worry, I'm here to help you troubleshoot the issue and get your touchpad back to normal.

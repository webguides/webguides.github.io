**Why Does My Laptop Keep Logging Off?**

Before we dive into the solutions, it's essential to understand the possible reasons behind this issue. Here are some common causes:

2. **Overheating**: When your laptop gets too hot, it may shut down to prevent damage to the internal components.
3. **Software Issues**: Conflicts between software programs or outdated drivers can cause your laptop to log off unexpectedly.
4. **Hardware Problems**: Faulty RAM, a failing hard drive, or a malfunctioning power button can also lead to this issue.
5. **Power Settings**: If your power settings are set to turn off the laptop after a certain period of inactivity, it may seem like your laptop is logging off randomly.

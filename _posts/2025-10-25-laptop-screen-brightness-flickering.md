**What causes laptop screen brightness flickering?**

Before we dive into the solutions, it's essential to understand what might be causing the problem in the first place. Here are some common culprits:

3. **Overheating**: Laptops can overheat, especially when running resource-intensive programs. This can cause the screen to flicker or turn off temporarily.
4. **Display Settings**: Incorrect display settings, such as a low refresh rate or an incompatible display mode, can also lead to screen flickering.
5. **Hardware Issues**: In some cases, the problem may be caused by a faulty display panel or a malfunctioning graphics card.

Before we dive into the solutions, let's talk about what might be causing this frustrating issue. There are several possible reasons why your laptop screen might be flickering when you move the lid:

3. **Display Driver Issues**: Outdated or corrupted display drivers can lead to display problems, including flickering.
4. **Power Supply Issues**: A weak or faulty power supply can cause display problems, including flickering.
5. **Physical Damage**: If your laptop has been dropped or subjected to physical stress, it can cause damage to the display or graphics card, leading to flickering.
